# 42 Malloc

42 Malloc is a custom memory allocator project created as part of the 42 coding school curriculum. This project implements a basic memory allocator with functionalities similar to `malloc` and `free` in C. It is designed to manage memory allocation and deallocation while maintaining efficient memory usage.

## Project Description

The 42 Malloc project involves implementing a custom memory management system in C. The main goal is to gain a deep understanding of how memory allocation works at a low level and to be able to manage memory manually. This project helps in learning about memory fragmentation, allocation strategies, and performance optimization.

### Key Features

- **Custom Allocation**: Implements `malloc`, `free`, and `realloc` functions.
- **Memory Management**: Handles memory allocation requests and deallocations.
- **Performance**: Designed to minimize fragmentation and optimize memory usage.
- **Debugging**: Provides features for memory usage tracking and debugging.
